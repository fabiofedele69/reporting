Below is a complete, clean, copy-paste-ready assessment pack that you can run in your environment to fully analyze:

✔ The materialized view definition
✔ Its refresh method and history
✔ Its dependencies
✔ Whether it is VALID or NEEDS_COMPILE
✔ Whether any jobs are refreshing it
✔ Whether FAST refresh is even possible
✔ Whether the source view changed
✔ Whether objects in the dependency chain are INVALID

This gives you everything DBAs normally collect before troubleshooting MV performance.

✅ SECTION 1 — Check materialized view definition (core metadata)

SELECT mview_name,
       owner,
       container_name,
       container_id,
       staleness,
       build_mode,
       refresh_mode,
       refresh_method,
       last_refresh_type,
       last_refresh_date,
       compile_state,
       interval
FROM dba_mviews
WHERE owner = 'LC_SCMT'
  AND mview_name = 'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M';

Interpretation:
STALENESS = NEEDS_COMPILE → MV must be compiled or recreated
REFRESH_METHOD = COMPLETE or FAST
REFRESH_MODE = ON DEMAND or ON COMMIT
INTERVAL NOT NULL → MV refresh scheduled at object level

✅ SECTION 2 — Retrieve the actual MV DDL (definition)

SELECT DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL('MATERIALIZED_VIEW',
                             'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M',
                             'LC_SCMT')
FROM DUAL;

This shows:
The SELECT used to populate the MV
All refresh options
Storage, logging, tablespace, etc.
If this returns (CLOB), click the CLOB to view it.

✅ SECTION 3 — Check MV refresh history (scheduler logs)

SELECT job_name,
       status,
       actual_start_date,
       run_duration,
       error#,
       additional_info
FROM dba_scheduler_job_run_details
WHERE job_name LIKE '%GFIU%'
ORDER BY actual_start_date DESC;

This tells you:
When refreshes fail
Why (ORA error)
Runtime duration

✅ SECTION 4 — Check if there is a scheduler job refreshing it

SELECT job_name,
       enabled,
       state,
       last_start_date,
       next_run_date,
       schedule_name,
       job_action
FROM dba_scheduler_jobs
WHERE UPPER(job_action) LIKE '%GFIU%'
   OR job_name LIKE '%GFIU%';

✅ SECTION 5 — Check if DBMS_JOB (legacy job) refreshes it

SELECT job, what, last_date, next_date, interval, failures
FROM dba_jobs
WHERE WHAT LIKE '%GFIU%'
   OR WHAT LIKE '%VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M%';

✅ SECTION 6 — Check MV dependencies (critical)

SELECT *
FROM dba_dependencies
WHERE name = 'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M'
  AND owner = 'LC_SCMT'
ORDER BY referenced_owner, referenced_name;

You will see:
Base view (VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_FF)
Any tables it uses
Any other objects (views, synonyms)

✅ SECTION 7 — Check VALID/INVALID status of dependent objects

SELECT owner, object_name, object_type, status
FROM dba_objects
WHERE owner = 'LC_SCMT'
  AND object_name IN (
        'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M',
        'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_FF'
      );

If either object is INVALID → refresh will fail.

✅ SECTION 8 — Check if FAST refresh is even possible

SELECT log_owner, master, log_table
FROM dba_mview_logs
WHERE master IN (
  SELECT referenced_name
  FROM dba_dependencies
  WHERE name = 'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_FF'
    AND owner = 'LC_SCMT'
);

If this returns zero rows, FAST refresh is impossible.

✅ SECTION 9 — Check row count & size of MV

SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_in_mv
FROM LC_SCMT.VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M;

For segment size:

SELECT segment_name, bytes/1024/1024 MB
FROM dba_segments
WHERE segment_name = 'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_M'
  AND owner = 'LC_SCMT';


✅ SECTION 10 — Check column list of MV source view (to detect breaking changes)

SELECT column_id, column_name, data_type
FROM dba_tab_columns
WHERE owner = 'LC_SCMT'
  AND table_name = 'VW_FCSMT_GFIU_NEW_FF'
ORDER BY column_id;

If column list changed after 08/08/2025 → MV must be recreated.

📌 OPTIONAL — Save all this to a spool file for DBA review

In SQL*Plus:

SPOOL mv_assessment.txt

-- paste all commands here

SPOOL OFF;

🟩 Next Steps (once you run these)

If you provide:
MV staleness (you already have)
MV refresh method
MV DDL
Dependencies
Refresh job details
Column list comparison (optional)

Then I will tell you:

✔ whether your MV can be compiled
✔ whether it must be recreated
✔ why refresh is failing
✔ what part of the view causes performance issues
✔ how to split the architecture safely
✔ how to guarantee a stable PROD refresh
